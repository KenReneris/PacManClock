# PacManClock
I had purchased a PacMan clock and the PacMan part of the clock was fine, but it couldn't keep time.   I decided to replace the CPU and write my own code that could keep time. In addition, I decided to add a variety of other 8bit arcade style animations.   I had a longer list, but I needed to stop playing around with the clock.

The CPU is a Wemos D1 Mini driving a 32x16 LED panel.  The case, panel, power supply are all from the original clock.

The clock syncs over Wifi to an NTP time source.  Since my primary use is for the clock to be at work the syncing is designed to only connect intermittently when I power on my personal hotspot.

Currently the clock is at work, and I'm stuck at home due to Covid-19.  When I get a chance I'll grab the clock and take some videos.
